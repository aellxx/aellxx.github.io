I've been blessed with the opportunities to grind for AWS certification exams the past 8-ish months, and as a result, I have 4 certifications under my belt[^1]. I personally think certifications do not speak for themselves 100%, since they are more theory than hands-on engineering, but I don't think they're completely not worth someone's time. The certifications I currently have had at least some overlap between each other, so the more certifications I get, the more I feel as if I'm internalizing the concepts. 

Given my interest in the AI/ML space, I am following the Machine Learning Engineer certification path suggested by AWS[^2], and with my most recent MLE certification, I decided to start the next certification on the list: [Data Engineer - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-engineer-associate/).  

As I study and prepare myself for the exam, I'll periodically update this page with the links to my learnings. Content-wise, I'm following the free [Standard Exam Prep Plan: AWS Certified Data Engineer - Associate (DEA-C01)](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/learning-plans/2195/standard-exam-prep-plan-aws-certified-data-engineer-associate-dea-c01) from AWS Skill Builder, but I might switch over to a Udemy course later on if the free course doesn't feel sufficient.
