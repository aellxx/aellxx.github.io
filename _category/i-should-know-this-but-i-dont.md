In [Big Data & 5Vs - Part 2](/aws/dea-c01/2025/04/19/big-data-and-5vs-pt-2), there is a section where I try explaining what Apache Kafka is, and there I mention how I should start a Things-I-should-know-but-I-don't series.

Well here I am starting it.

Studying for AWS certifications meant having to learn about AWS services, and I remember being super puzzled when I read descriptions along the lines of:

> Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) is a fully managed service that enables you to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka to process streaming data.[^1]

Now there's nothing wrong with how AWS describes their MSK service. The issue was with me having absolutely no idea of what Apache Kafka was, so I did the next reasonable thing: ask [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

![I asked what Apache Kafka is on Perplexity](/assets/i-should-know-this-but-i-dont/perplexity-kafka.png)

Now I was _really_ confused. What even is an "event streaming platform"? What does it mean for that to be "distributed"? What does it mean for systems to "handle" real-time data? Given the timeframe I had to study for my past 4 certs, I brute-force memorized the descriptions, and don't get me wrong, I was able to answer exam questions just fine.

But something felt off, like I wasn't internalizing anything.

So that's the whole premise of this new series, one that I decided to call **I-should-know-this-but-I-don't**. This series probably isn't for everyone, since I'm going to get super nit-picky and question everything about how terms are used to describe and explain concepts. However, it _is_ for those of you who are bit like me, who can't stand just memorizing things word-for-word without having the "gut-feeling" that you understand something.

Hope this helps,<br>Ael
