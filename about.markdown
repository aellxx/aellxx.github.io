Hello Stranger 🙂

I might be just another random dev that you come across on the Internet, but if you found this, then let me introduce myself: 

I'm Ael[^1], and I am a software engineer who works daily in the AWS Cloud. My interests lie somewhere in between cloud computing, AI/ML solution design, and NLP. 

I started this blog mainly to record my learnings and give structure to the messy, exciting process of leveling up in AI/ML, as well as other tech-related things I pick up. I’ve found that writing things down — the concepts that click, the ones that don’t, and the occasional dead ends — helps me learn faster and internalize new concept. Hopefully this blog will offer something useful to others walking a similar path.

So if you’re into ML, NLP, or just curious about how a cloud developer navigates this wild space, you’re in the right place.

Expect a mix of:
- Explorations of ML concepts I’m trying to wrap my head around
- Project breakdowns and experiments (successful or otherwise)
- Thoughts on building intelligent systems in the cloud
- The occasional rant or rabbit hole


Thanks for stopping by — and feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aellee/) if you want to chat or geek out about anything I write here.

Let’s learn, build, and backprop our brains together. 🙂
